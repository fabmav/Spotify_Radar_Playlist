# Best New Track Radar

The aim of this project is to create a meta playlist of trending tracks based on selected playlists from well known sources such as Pitchfork, the NME, Stereogum etc...
It's just easier to have everything in one big playlist!
This gives roughly 800 to 900 tracks. If listened in random, this create a kind of radio. 
You can also sort the playlist by recently added tracks to get freshly added tracks first.

I will also use this playlist as a basis for some data analysis based on the data available from spotify API.
