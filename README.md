# Best New Track Radar

The aim of this project is to create a meta playlist of trending tracks based on well known.
It's just easier to have everything in one big playlist!
This create a kind of radio wich can be updated at will. It currently scan ...
This gives roughly 800 to 900 tracks. Assuming that you listen this playlist for one hour every day in random mode it would take... days to listen.

This project is also the opportunity to use my data analytics skills.
